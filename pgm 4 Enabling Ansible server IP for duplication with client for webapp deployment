First step up is 
Launching of two ec2 instances one consisting of ansible host and control server respectively
Note: for security group you need to enable only ssh 22 
And launch the two instances

Open client mobaxterm SSH
Copy  public IP of host and control server ansible from AWS that have recently launced

In Control Server follow this procedure

                                $sudo su –
                                $ yum update

                                In ansible client
                                $sudo su –
                                $ yum update

In Control Server follow this procedure
                                $ yum install ansible
                                $ rpm –Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
                                $ yum install ansible
                                $ ansible --version

                                $ useradd  ansadmin
                                $ passwd ansadmin
                                Provide the password of your own in the password section

                                $ yum install ansible
                                $ rpm –Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
                                $ yum install ansible
                                $ ansible –version

In ansible client

                                $ useradd  ansadmin
                                $ passwd ansadmin
                                Provide the password of your own in the password section

In Control Server
                                $ visudo
In ansible client

                                $ visudo
In Control Server

                                $ cd /etc/ssh
                                $ ls
                                $ vi sshd_config
                                Type in the following by enabling the password authentication  has yes

                                $ service sshd restart

In ansible client
                                $ cd /etc/ssh
                                $ ls
                                $ vi sshd_config
                                Type in the following by enabling the password authentication  has yes

                                $ service sshd restart

                                Now right click on the ansible control server tab in your client click on duplicate tab. This will open a duplicate tab and features the replication of ansible server


In Duplicate control server tab (here you need to generate ssh)
                                $ sudo su ansadmin
                                 $ssh-keygen
                                Press enter don’t type password
                                $ls –la
                                There should be file by name .ssh or else error

Go to ansible client
                                $ ifconfig
                                This gives you the private ip of your ansible  client and copy this IP 

In Duplicate control server tab
                                $ cd .ssh
                                $ ls
                                $ ssh-copy-id  <private ip of ansible  client> //this is how you deploy several clients in to    server control area dynamically//
                                Below snap shot result with copy without authentication 
                                Note: if it asks the password than its an error

To come out of client ip 
                                $ ssh <client private ip>
                                $ exit
                                Connection will be closed
                                To execute and deploy features of ansible configuration in devops strategy , in  duplicate server  follow the procedure
                                $ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
                                For reference we a have taken an example IP , you go to type your  respective host/client IP
                                $ ansible all –m ping


                                $ls

                                $ cd ..
                                $ls
                                $pwd
                                $cat  >  hello.html
                                <h1> hello welcome .. welcome to devops </h1>
                                $ls
                                Displays hello.html file


In your ansible client
                                $cd /home/ansadmin
                                $ls
                                $pwd
                                $ls
                                 Go back to your control server
                                $ ansible all –m copy “src=/home/amsadmin/hello.html  dest=/home/ansadmin”


In your client
                                $ls -l
